##  🧮 Number Cipher Encryptor & Decoder

This project implements a basic **Number Cipher** that converts letters into numbers (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26) and vice versa. It's a simple encryption and decryption tool based on numeric representation of letters.

## 🔐 Features

- Encrypts alphabetic text into number codes
- Decodes number codes back into text
- Handles spaces and special characters
- Replaces whitespaces with `||` for accurate decoding

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- No external libraries required

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Run the script:
   
2. Follow the prompts:

    - Choose to Encrypt or Decode via changing which function to use
    - Provide input when asked

    Example:

    Type the text you want to be encrypted: HELLO
    Output: 8 5 12 12 15

## 📘 Notes
Uppercase letters are used for encryption.
Two spaces in input are represented by || to avoid confusion with letter spacing.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Character encoding using ASCII values
- Custom text formatting and string manipulation
- Reversible simple cipher design
