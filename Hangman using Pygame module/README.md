# Hangman Game (Pygame)

This is a graphical implementation of the classic **Hangman** game using the `pygame` library. The player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn.

## 🎮 Features

- Visual interface with clickable letter buttons
- Random word selection from a text file
- Tracks correct and incorrect guesses
- Displays win/loss message with the correct word
- Reset and play again without restarting the game

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pygame
- Text file input/output

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install Pygame:

   pip install pygame

2. Ensure the words.txt file and hangman images (hangman0.png to hangman6.png) are in the same directory.

3. Run the script.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Event-driven game programming
- Button interaction with mouse clicks
- Displaying text and images in Pygame
- Managing game state (win/loss, reset, etc.)
