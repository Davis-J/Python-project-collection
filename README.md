# Python Project Collection

This repository contains python projects which I did to improve my understanding of the language and problem-solving skills. This was the first programming language I learned and they were made 2 years ago. Since then, I've learned a lot more about OOP principles and best coding practices and I plan on refactoring a lot of the code in these projects. They range from simple tools to more complex games.

## Projects

- **Calculator**: A basic calculator with arithmetic functions.
- **Caesar Cipher**: Encrypt/decrypt messages with Caesar cipher logic.
- **Number Cipher**: Encrypt/decrypt messages with Number cipher logic.
- **Restricted Rock Paper Scissors**: The classic game of rock paper scissors with a twist inspired by the show "Kaiji".
- **Predictive Cricket Game**: Game of cricket which uses inputs and calculates runs based on how lucky the input is.
- **Text File Pseudo Database**: Simulates simple data storage using python via a text file.
- **Turtle Race**: Visual race game using the Turtle graphics module and random module.
- **Pygame - Tic Tac Toe**: Classic game built with Pygame.
- **Pygame - Hangman**: Visual word guessing game.
