# Caesar Cipher Encryptor

A simple command-line Caesar Cipher tool that shifts letters in a given string by a specified amount.

## 🔐 What It Does

The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter is shifted a certain number of positions in the alphabet. This script supports both uppercase and lowercase letters and leaves punctuation unchanged.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard library only (no external packages)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Run the script:

2. Follow the prompts:

    Type the text you want to be encrypted: Hello
    Type the amount it's shifting (Value should be less than 26 and more than -26): 3

    Output: Khoor
